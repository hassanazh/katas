## System Description
MonitorMe is a medical patient monitoring system developed by StayHealthy, Inc., a prominent medical software company based in San Francisco, California. The system is designed to monitor patients' vital signs using proprietary medical monitoring devices built by StayHealthy, Inc.

StayHealthy, Inc. currently offers two popular cloud-based SaaS products: MonitorThem and MyMedicalData. MonitorThem is a comprehensive data analytics platform used for hospital trend and performance analytics, while MyMedicalData is a cloud-based patient medical records system. MonitorMe represents StayHealthy, Inc.'s expansion into the medical monitoring market.

## Key Requirements
- MonitorMe reads data from eight different patient-monitoring equipment vital sign input sources.
- It sends the data to a consolidated monitoring screen per nurses station with an average response time of 1 second or less.
- For each vital sign, MonitorMe records and stores the past 24 hours of all vital sign readings.
- The software analyzes each patientâ€™s vital signs and alerts medical professionals if it detects an issue or reaches a preset threshold.
- Some trend and threshold analysis is dependent on whether the patient is awake or asleep.
- Medical professionals receive alert push notifications to a StayHealthy mobile app and the consolidated monitoring screen.
- MonitorMe must still function if any vital sign device or software fails.
- Medical staff can generate holistic snapshots from a patient's consolidated vital signs and upload them to MyMedicalData.

## System Architecture
The architecture of MonitorMe is designed to support on-premises deployment in each physical hospital location. Each installation includes the complete MonitorMe system, including recorded raw monitoring data. StayHealthy, Inc. provides comprehensive hardware and software for the system.

## Future Enhancements
StayHealthy, Inc. plans to add more vital sign monitoring devices for MonitorMe in the future. Continuous improvements and updates are expected as the company learns more about the medical monitoring market.

## Confidentiality and Compliance
StayHealthy, Inc. takes patient confidentiality seriously, and MonitorMe is designed to ensure the security and privacy of patient monitoring data. While data security is a priority, MonitorMe does not have to meet specific government regulatory requirements such as HIPPA.
